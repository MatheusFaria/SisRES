  <mainDescription>The focus of DSDM is on delivering the necessary functionality at the required time. The computer system can be more&#xD;
rigorously engineered later if such an approach is acceptable. Traditionally the focus has been on satisfying the contents&#xD;
of a requirements document and conforming to previous deliverables, even though the requirements are often inaccurate, the&#xD;
previous deliverables may be flawed and the business needs may have changed since the start of the project.</mainDescription>
