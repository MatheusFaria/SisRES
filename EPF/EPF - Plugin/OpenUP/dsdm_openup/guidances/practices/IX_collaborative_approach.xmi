  <mainDescription>The nature of DSDM projects means that low-level requirements are not necessarily fixed when the developers are originally&#xD;
approached to carry out the work. Hence the short-term direction that a project takes must be quickly decided without&#xD;
recourse to restrictive change control procedures. The stakeholders include not only the business and development staff&#xD;
within the project, but also other staff such as Service Delivery or resource managers. &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When development is procured from an external supplier, both the vendor and the purchaser organisations should aim for&#xD;
    as efficient a process as possible while allowing for flexibility during both the pre-contract phase and when the&#xD;
    contracted work is carried out.&#xD;
