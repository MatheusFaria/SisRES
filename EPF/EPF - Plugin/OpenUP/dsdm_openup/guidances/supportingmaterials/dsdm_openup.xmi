    In 1999, Rational Software and the DSDM Consortium collaborated to produce a RUP/DSDM interoperability paper (see &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../dsdm_openup/guidances/whitepapers/dsdm_rup.html&quot; guid=&quot;_6LZh8FlkEdu-hcil0jQ6jA&quot;>DSDM and the Rational Unified Process&lt;/a>&quot;). Much of that paper remains relevant when&#xD;
    considering using DSDM with OpenUP. The following excerpt is particularly appropriate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        To quote the DSDM Manual,&lt;br />&#xD;
         “DSDM is more a framework than a method. It does not say how things should be done in detail, but provides a&#xD;
        skeleton process and product descriptions that are to be tailored to suit a particular project or a particular&#xD;
        organisation”.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    In this sense, OpenUP complements DSDM by providing detailed guidance for the technical aspects of software&#xD;
    development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    Further, the paper notes that&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
        &quot;It was suggested in an early meeting of the team that DSDM was a paradigm – you can approach software development&#xD;
        with a DSDM frame of mind, almost regardless of the process...If you are a RUP user and need to adopt a&#xD;
        business-centred RAD approach then DSDM will provide many useful techniques...&lt;strong>In an ideal world it would be&#xD;
        nice to have all these techniques defined in a shopping basket or tool kit from which you could pick the&#xD;
        appropriate techniques regardless of the process being utilised.&lt;/strong>&quot; (&lt;em>original emphasis&lt;/em>)&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    The Eclipse Process Framework in general - and Method Composer in particular - provide such a tool kit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    OpenUP/Basic defines a process that is minimal and complete from a technical team perspective. DSDM, like many Agile&#xD;
    methods, promotes active user involvement on a project. OpenUP provides for this with a minimalistic definition of the&#xD;
    Stakeholder role. The DSDM Plugin for OpenUP extends this Stakeholder role by adding four business roles and assigns&#xD;
    them specific responsibilities for key aspects of the project. These roles are;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Executive Sponsor&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Visionary&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ambassador User&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Advisor User&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These roles are applied to OpenUP in a complementary fashion. For simplicity, the DSDM roles have been applied to&#xD;
    existing Tasks and Products - no new tasks or products have been introduced to OpenUP in this plugin.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The addition of these roles to OpenUP promotes an&amp;nbsp; &lt;span     style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA&quot;>explicitly&lt;/span>&#xD;
    collaborative approach , where software development responsibility is shared by the business and technical communities.&#xD;
    It is the experience of DSDM practitioners and the wider Agile community that this significantly enhances the potential&#xD;
    for a successful project.&#xD;
