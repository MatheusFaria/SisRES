  <mainDescription>&lt;P>The full DSDM product provides a framework for development projects that encompasses all aspects for successful delivery: people, process and technology - with the emphasis on people, since more projects fail because of some people-based problem than for any other reason. &lt;/P>
&lt;P>The framework is based on nine DSDM Underlying Principles&amp;nbsp;that enable projects to deliver what the organisation needs when it needs it. &lt;/P>
&lt;P>The framework defines a set of phases that any new/changing system (IT or business) will pass through - from initial identification of a problem or opportunity to be addressed through the development of the new/changed system to keeping the system operating successfully. These are described in the DSDM Process Overview. &lt;/P>
&lt;P>Various DSDM Products are produced within each phase. These are defined to a level that enables them to be used in any development environment. &lt;/P>
&lt;P>As stated above, the people aspects are essential, so DSDM defines key roles and responsibilities for people working inside and alongside the development. &lt;/P>
&lt;P>Every project will have the need for management techniques to control the process, such as good project planning, risk management, quality management. DSDM provides guidance on management techniques focussing on aspects of control that are specific to fast-moving development work. The Management Techniques section covers all the essentials needed for a controlled and yet flexible approach. &lt;/P>
&lt;P>Management is not the complete answer, the people within a project will be carrying out various activities from identifying how to create the solution to the business problem or opportunity through building and testing the solution to putting it into operation. &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;>DSDM has several core Development Techniques that assist the project team in these activities.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; />&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P>
&lt;P>DSDM recognises that every project is unique. Hence, a list of factors to consider when starting a DSDM project are provided in the When to Use DSDM section together with a Suitability Risk/List for ascertaining early in the project what aspects may cause problems later. Moreover, projects come in all sizes and guises, so guidance on Tailoring DSDM for specific projects is also provided. &lt;/P>
&lt;P>Lastly for those organisations (or parts of organisations) that have never used DSDM before, guidance is provided about Introducing DSDM into an organisation. &lt;/P></mainDescription>
