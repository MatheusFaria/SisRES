  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Visionary is a business role. The Visionary is the one who is usually responsible for getting a project started&#xD;
    through enthusiasm and commitment to the idea and business goals. The Visionary should remain involved throughout the&#xD;
    design and delivery process to ensure the original objectives are being met. If any issues arise during the project,&#xD;
    which must be considered by higher management, the Visionary will either provide the decision or provide higher&#xD;
    management with the business viewpoint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Visionary role ensures the project excellence from the business point of view and the Technical Co-ordinator does&#xD;
    the same from the technical point of view.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Commitment and availability throughout the development cycle&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Visionary has the high-level view of the original reasons for initiating the project: this must not be dissipated&#xD;
    during development. Unfortunately, this happens in many projects. It is very easy once development is under way to&#xD;
    involve only those staff who will use the computer system on a day-to-day basis but who, perhaps, do not fully&#xD;
    understand all the business vision. This can result in a dilution of the original goals and a tendency towards simply&#xD;
    re-specifying the system to be replaced. It is imperative that the Visionary is present when important user events&#xD;
    occur or when management decisions about the progress of the project are made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Visionary must commit business staff to the project as &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../dsdm_openup/roles/ambassador_user.html&quot; guid=&quot;_ctbZ8FkVEdul8L-IGeA7TA&quot;>Ambassador User&lt;/a>(s). These people should be available to the project on a continuous basis throughout the life of the project -&#xD;
    not necessarily full-time but &quot;contracts&quot; for the Ambassador Users time should be agreed with the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup_basic/roles/project_manager.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Project Manager&lt;/a> before leaving the Business Study phase, e.g. &quot;Ambassador User X&#xD;
    will work in the project team every Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning&quot;. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../dsdm_openup/roles/advisor_user.html&quot; guid=&quot;_avOA0FkVEdul8L-IGeA7TA&quot;>Advisor User&lt;/a>(s) involvement will be more &lt;em>ad hoc&lt;/em> but should be well planned in advance.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    &lt;li>
        Excellent communicator
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Excellent awareness of business goals
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        High-level awareness of technological possibilities.
