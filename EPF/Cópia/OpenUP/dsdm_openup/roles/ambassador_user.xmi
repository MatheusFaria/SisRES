  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role provides the key focus for design decisions. Working closely with the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup_basic/roles/project_manager.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Project Manager&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup_basic/roles/developer.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0YDosMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Developer&lt;/a>(s), &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup_basic/roles/tester.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0ZM4MclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Tester&lt;/a>(s) and&#xD;
    the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup_basic/roles/architect.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0X9iEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Architect&lt;/a>, the Ambassador User drives the system's requirements, bringing&amp;nbsp;input&#xD;
    and ideas to the various sessions on behalf of the users; and keeping the other users informed of what is happening.&#xD;
    The holder of the Ambassador User role must have the desire, authority, responsibility and knowledge to be able to&#xD;
    ensure that the right system is built for the business. This does not necessarily imply a senior position within the&#xD;
    organisation, but a level of empowerment during the project to fulfil the role and a clear allocation of time to&#xD;
    participate in the project as required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Responsibilities&quot; name=&quot;Responsibilities&quot;>Responsibilities&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h2>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Providing key input to business requirements and design sessions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communicating with other users and getting their agreement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Providing input into prototyping sessions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reviewing documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reviewing and accepting delivered software&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Providing user documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensuring user training is adequately carried out&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Organising and controlling user testing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ambassador Users must be representative of the entire community of users. The whole user community should see them as&#xD;
    such - not just the user management. They must have authority delegated to them to make decisions and to guide the work&#xD;
    of the developers. This is particularly important when considering changes of scope due to time limitations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <skills>&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>
    &lt;li>
        Knowledge of the relevant business area goals and the organisation politics
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        High-level view of how the computer system should function to support the business
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Good communication skills
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to disseminate knowledge and ideas.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></skills>
  <assignmentApproaches>&lt;p>
    Ambassador Users should have a positive attitude towards the development since they will be exposed to a whole raft of
    new ideas and technologies that can be daunting.
&lt;/p>

    For some critical projects, it may be necessary for Ambassador Users to be on the project full-time, but this is often
    not possible and may even be counter-productive.&lt;/span> It is perfectly acceptable for an Ambassador User to be
    part-time. However, the presence on the project needs to be continuous, e.g. at specified times of the day and/or on
    agreed days of every week.
